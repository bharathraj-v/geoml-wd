# Geospatial Machine Learning Working Directory

Final repo containing code from the paper - https://github.com/bharathraj-v/pv-detection 

Paper link  - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10490316



This directory contains the research internship work for a paper co-authored by me and Dr. Prakash P S, a researcher at the Irish Center for High-end Computing, that aims to apply geospatial machine learning techniques to analyze and model photovoltaic panels' geospatial data. 
## Technologies

The following technologies are used in this project:

- Geospatial Packages: [Conda geospatial package](https://geospatial.gishub.org/)
- Machine Learning: [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org) and/or [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org).

All packages and libraries used are listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: contains Jupyter notebooks with code and analysis.
- `models/`: contains trained machine learning models.
- `reports/`: contains weekly reports and visualizations generated during the project.
