# Geospatial Machine Learning Working Directory

This is the working directory of the internship work that aims to apply machine learning techniques to geospatial data.

## Technologies

The project is implemented in Python, using the following libraries:

Geospatial Packages: https://geospatial.gishub.org/

Machine Learning: [Tensorflow](tensorflow.org) and/or [Pytorch](pytorch.org)

Every package and technology used is listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: contains Jupyter notebooks with code and analysis.
- `models/`: contains trained machine learning models.
- `reports/`: contains weekly reports and visualizations generated.
